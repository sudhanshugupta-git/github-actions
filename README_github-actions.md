### Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Add Your Project Files

1. Copy your existing project files (including `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, and any other necessary files) into the cloned repository directory.
2. Ensure your project structure looks something like this:

```
/your-repo
  ├── backend/
  ├── frontend/
  ├── docker-compose.yml
  └── README.md
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Inside your repository, create a directory for GitHub Actions workflows:

   ```
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create a new YAML file for your workflow, e.g., `ci-cd.yml`:

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       services:
         mysql:
           image: mysql:5.7
           env:
             MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
             MYSQL_DATABASE: sakila
             MYSQL_USER: admin
             MYSQL_PASSWORD: 12345678
           ports:
             - 3306:3306
           options: >-
             --health-cmd="mysqladmin ping -h localhost"
             --health-interval=10s
             --health-timeout=5s
             --health-retries=3

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Docker Buildx
           uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

         - name: Build and push Docker images
           uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
           with:
             context: .
             push: true
             tags: |
               sudhanshugpta/backend-app:v2
               sudhanshugpta/frontend-app:v3

         - name: Run Docker Compose
           run: docker-compose up -d

         - name: Run tests
           run: |
             # Add commands to run your tests here
             echo "Running tests..."

         - name: Tear down Docker Compose
           if: always()
           run: docker-compose down
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings.
2. Under "Secrets and variables," add any necessary secrets (e.g., database passwords, API keys) that your application needs to run.

### Step 5: Commit and Push Changes

1. Commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Monitor Your Workflow

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of your workflow.
2. You should see the workflow running on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

1. After the workflow completes successfully, verify that your application is running as expected.
2. You can check the logs in the "Actions" tab or directly access your deployed application.

### Additional Notes

- Adjust the Docker image tags and other configurations as necessary for your project.
- Ensure that your backend and frontend applications are properly configured to connect to the MySQL service.
- You may want to add additional steps for testing, linting, or other CI/CD practices as needed.

This setup provides a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for your Dockerized applications. You can expand upon this by adding more complex workflows, notifications, or deployment strategies as your project grows.
